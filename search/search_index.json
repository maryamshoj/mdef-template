That is why, whenever humans return to nature, they learn not to forget their essence, to avoid greed, to be patient, kind, and to embrace many other lessons that nature teaches. Nature guides us inward, toward self-awareness. Perhaps if the world\u2019s political leaders were also more aware of themselves, they would learn patience. They might understand that on this tiny planet, we humans are the smallest particles in the vastness of galaxies, and that war serves no purpose other than exhausting ourselves and depleting our resources.

Since I cannot set aside my passion for horses, I chose a topic based on the challenges that arise from excessive pressure on show-jumping horses. This pressure is not always purely physical; mental stress can also significantly affect the horse, sometimes causing trauma. Trainers often push horses to perform flawlessly in competitions or to improve their own rankings among riders. This frequently involves heavy competition schedules, which can lead to both physical injuries and mental strain for the horse over time. It is important to acknowledge that horses deserve a normal life, and humans should not treat them merely as tools to achieve personal goals, such as high scores in competitions. Horses, like any living beings, can experience fatigue, and our use of them as instruments for human ambition does not align with their natural needs. To explore this subject in depth, I conducted research in several areas. I gathered insights from trainers and active equestrians, studied the historical role of horses in human society, examined equestrian competitions, and investigated horse body language. The following video showcases some of my research in this field. Project Focus \u00b6 This project examines the complex relationship between humans and horses\u2014a relationship that oscillates between love, dominance, and sometimes competition. On the surface, this relationship appears as trust and coordination between two bodies, but beneath it lies pressure, inequality, and misunderstanding. The setting is not necessarily limited to an arena; any environment can serve as a platform for reflecting on this relationship. Layer One: Pressure from the Scoring System In equestrian competitions, each point represents success for humans, but for horses, it can signify fatigue, strain, or even injury. To achieve higher scores, riders often push horses beyond their limits, causing physical exhaustion. This project aims to reveal this hidden cycle: a visual representation shows a score table on a monitor alongside a human whose body becomes progressively more fatigued and worn with each point\u2014symbolizing the horse\u2019s physical and emotional burden. The human body becomes a metaphor for the horse\u2019s body, carrying effort, pain, and obedience simultaneously. Layer Two: Freedom and Choice for Horses The project questions the autonomy of horses: Are they truly at ease? Do they choose humans consciously? Would they be freer in open fields, experiencing wind and earth, rather than confined to a three-meter stall? Horses are typically taken out of their stalls only for training or competitions, spending most of their time waiting for scheduled feeding. In the best case, their enjoyment is limited to finding a carrot or receiving a small reward. This enforced stillness reflects a life where freedom becomes discipline, and joy becomes duty. Layer Three: Miscommunication Between Humans and Horses Humans cannot fully understand horse language, just as horses do not fully understand ours. Yet, we communicate through body language, sound, tone, gaze, and movement. Inspired by this, I designed an exercise in which two humans, who do not share a spoken language, interact using only voice, tone, gestures, and body posture. They then explain what they understood from each other. This experience mirrors the human-horse relationship, where words are absent and only perception, attention, and signals remain\u2014similar to a horse silently asking for something through its gaze or ear movements, leaving us to interpret. Potential Impacts of the Project \u00b6 Reveal Hidden Inequalities \u2013 Challenge the mechanical, score-focused approach in equestrian competitions and encourage a redefinition of success. Foster Physical Empathy \u2013 Allow the audience to not just see but feel the pressure, fatigue, and expectations from the horse\u2019s perspective. Redefine Human-Animal Relationships \u2013 Shift from dominance to understanding, respect, and coexistence. Encourage Ethical Reflection and Behavior Change \u2013 Invite reflection through body language and emotion rather than judgment. Promote Cross-Species Communication \u2013 Highlight that understanding can occur through observation, touch, and silence beyond verbal language. Measurable Objectives \u00b6 Experience Empathy \u2013 At least 70% of participants report feeling fatigue, limitation, or empathy with the horse (via forms or discussion). Critical Understanding \u2013 Participants can identify and discuss one unfair or overlooked practice in equestrian sports. Attitude Change \u2013 At least half of participants express willingness to reconsider the human-animal relationship. Observable Physical Reactions \u2013 Record changes in body language (movement speed, posture, gestures) during various parts of the experience. Long-Term Recall \u2013 Participants recall the core emotional experience in follow-up discussions days later. Type of Action \u00b6 The main action of the project combines resistance, protest, and invitation to reform: Resistance \u2013 Against instrumental and score-focused treatment of animals, simulating human exhaustion as a metaphor for the horse\u2019s body. Protest \u2013 Visual and emotional demonstration of unfair systems that ignore animal well-being. Invitation to Reform \u2013 Engaging audiences empathetically, encouraging reflection without violence or blame. The experience can be presented in three stations: Scores and Fatigue Display \u2013 A monitor shows scores while a human body becomes progressively exhausted, symbolizing the horse\u2019s strain. Confined Three-Meter Space \u2013 A controlled environment with intermittent sounds and silence to create a sense of waiting and limitation. Practical Experiment \u00b6 To fully understand my topic, I combined layers one and two by simulating the life of a show-jumping horse. I created a scenario to experience life in a small stall for 12 hours, simulating the confinement and conditions of competition. I observed behaviors I could emulate to gain a better understanding of the horse\u2019s experience. Despite my asthma and heart condition, I pushed myself as far as possible to execute this hypothesis. (Video of the performed action) Insights from Interviews and Observations \u00b6 Through interviews with riders and trainers, I identified key factors for preparing horses for competitions with less stress and more readiness: Specifying rest, training, and training type for each horse. Avoiding tasks beyond the horse\u2019s capability, understanding its physical limits, and knowing suitable jump heights. Considering veterinarians, nutrition, environment, medication, and post-training care such as massage and ice therapy. Ensuring harmony between horse and rider, built through shared time and mutual understanding. Recognizing that humans cannot fully interpret horse language; we rely on posture and body language to approximate meaning, similar to communicating with someone who speaks a different language. This reflection emphasizes the importance of empathy, awareness, and adaptation in fostering a healthier, more ethical relationship between humans and horses.","title":"Design Studio 1"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20studio%201/#design-studio-1-project-overview","text":"In Design Studio 1, we were asked to select a topic aligned with our personal interests.

We explored how we might improve and elevate ourselves by using our abilities and various tools, ultimately becoming better versions of who we are. In the following layers of the course, we considered what it would be like if we transformed into another being\u2014or possessed the abilities of other creatures\u2014and approached these ideas with a more creative perspective. Later, we analyzed how we would like others to perceive us, and how we could present and communicate that image. This course was particularly interesting for me because it genuinely taught me how to observe situations, people, and even myself from an external and alternative point of view. Day One: Becoming the Best Version of Myself \u00b6 Since childhood, I have had hearing difficulties and hear less than the average person. I have been wearing hearing aids since the age of five, and living with weak hearing\u2014even with hearing aids\u2014has always been a challenging experience. I have always wanted to reduce the impact of this challenge. What makes the process more complex is that doctors usually increase the sensitivity of hearing aids gradually and infrequently, since delivering excessive sound directly into the ear can cause further damage. Because of this, I wanted to design an external tool that could improve natural sound reception without transmitting sound directly into the ear. I created a device made of aluminum\u2014a material that does not absorb sound but reflects it. I designed its angle so that it naturally gathers and directs sound toward the ear, concentrating sound waves in the center before passing them along. This allows sounds to be amplified more naturally without artificial intervention, and without causing harm. Ultimately, I hope to turn this concept into an earring\u2014something both aesthetically pleasing and functional, easy to wear, and helpful for daily use. Day Two: Becoming Something Else \u00b6 On this day, we were asked to choose an ability from any creature we admired and design a tool that would allow us to use that ability. I have always found wall-climbing and rock-climbing extremely fascinating, as well as handstands\u2014being able to firmly connect to the ground with my hands and balance with my legs in the air. The concept I developed was a pair of gloves equipped with suction pads. These pads create suction upon contact with a wall, allowing the user to adhere to and move along vertical surfaces. The suction pads are made of rubber, while the glove itself is plastic so it can fully conform to the shape of the hand and fit securely. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA9RkvwKXEo Day Three: How We Want Others to See Us \u00b6 For this part, I wanted to add a humorous touch to my design. Since I love sleeping and have always enjoyed it since childhood, I also wished that others would see me as awake and alert\u2014even when I\u2019m not. So, I created a pair of glasses with an image of my own open, attentive eyes behind the lenses, allowing me to sleep behind them. Since I normally wear glasses due to my weak eyesight, I used my own frames. The result was extremely amusing. In addition to this, we were required to become \u201cdetectives\u201d and observe our subjects at a specific time, or be observed by others ourselves. The idea was to see ourselves from someone else\u2019s perspective, and to explore how we wish to be perceived. It also helped us understand how to follow a subject carefully and accurately if we were the detective. This concept was inspired by Sophie Calle\u2019s book Double Game \u2013 The Detective, where the main character hires a detective to observe her and reveal how she appears from an external viewpoint. We recreated this concept, and I became the detective who observed one of my classmates. I documented my observations along with the exact times.

We explored how we might improve and elevate ourselves by using our abilities and various tools, ultimately becoming better versions of who we are. In the following layers of the course, we considered what it would be like if we transformed into another being\u2014or possessed the abilities of other creatures\u2014and approached these ideas with a more creative perspective. Later, we analyzed how we would like others to perceive us, and how we could present and communicate that image. This course was particularly interesting for me because it genuinely taught me how to observe situations, people, and even myself from an external and alternative point of view.","title":"Overview of the Course"},{"location":"term1/03-reflection%20I/#day-one-becoming-the-best-version-of-myself","text":"Since childhood, I have had hearing difficulties and hear less than the average person. I have been wearing hearing aids since the age of five, and living with weak hearing\u2014even with hearing aids\u2014has always been a challenging experience. I have always wanted to reduce the impact of this challenge. What makes the process more complex is that doctors usually increase the sensitivity of hearing aids gradually and infrequently, since delivering excessive sound directly into the ear can cause further damage. Because of this, I wanted to design an external tool that could improve natural sound reception without transmitting sound directly into the ear. I created a device made of aluminum\u2014a material that does not absorb sound but reflects it. I designed its angle so that it naturally gathers and directs sound toward the ear, concentrating sound waves in the center before passing them along. This allows sounds to be amplified more naturally without artificial intervention, and without causing harm. Ultimately, I hope to turn this concept into an earring\u2014something both aesthetically pleasing and functional, easy to wear, and helpful for daily use.","title":"Day One: Becoming the Best Version of Myself"},{"location":"term1/03-reflection%20I/#day-two-becoming-something-else","text":"On this day, we were asked to choose an ability from any creature we admired and design a tool that would allow us to use that ability. I have always found wall-climbing and rock-climbing extremely fascinating, as well as handstands\u2014being able to firmly connect to the ground with my hands and balance with my legs in the air. The concept I developed was a pair of gloves equipped with suction pads. These pads create suction upon contact with a wall, allowing the user to adhere to and move along vertical surfaces. The suction pads are made of rubber, while the glove itself is plastic so it can fully conform to the shape of the hand and fit securely. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA9RkvwKXEo","title":"Day Two: Becoming Something Else"},{"location":"term1/03-reflection%20I/#day-three-how-we-want-others-to-see-us","text":"For this part, I wanted to add a humorous touch to my design. Since I love sleeping and have always enjoyed it since childhood, I also wished that others would see me as awake and alert\u2014even when I\u2019m not. So, I created a pair of glasses with an image of my own open, attentive eyes behind the lenses, allowing me to sleep behind them. Since I normally wear glasses due to my weak eyesight, I used my own frames. The result was extremely amusing. In addition to this, we were required to become \u201cdetectives\u201d and observe our subjects at a specific time, or be observed by others ourselves. The idea was to see ourselves from someone else\u2019s perspective, and to explore how we wish to be perceived. It also helped us understand how to follow a subject carefully and accurately if we were the detective. This concept was inspired by Sophie Calle\u2019s book Double Game \u2013 The Detective, where the main character hires a detective to observe her and reveal how she appears from an external viewpoint. We recreated this concept, and I became the detective who observed one of my classmates. I documented my observations along with the exact times.
