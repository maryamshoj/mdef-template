That is why, whenever humans return to nature, they learn not to forget their essence, to avoid greed, to be patient, kind, and to embrace many other lessons that nature teaches. Nature guides us inward, toward self-awareness. Perhaps if the world\u2019s political leaders were also more aware of themselves, they would learn patience. They might understand that on this tiny planet, we humans are the smallest particles in the vastness of galaxies, and that war serves no purpose other than exhausting ourselves and depleting our resources.

Since I cannot set aside my passion for horses, I chose a topic based on the challenges that arise from excessive pressure on show-jumping horses. This pressure is not always purely physical; mental stress can also significantly affect the horse, sometimes causing trauma. Trainers often push horses to perform flawlessly in competitions or to improve their own rankings among riders. This frequently involves heavy competition schedules, which can lead to both physical injuries and mental strain for the horse over time. It is important to acknowledge that horses deserve a normal life, and humans should not treat them merely as tools to achieve personal goals, such as high scores in competitions. Horses, like any living beings, can experience fatigue, and our use of them as instruments for human ambition does not align with their natural needs. To explore this subject in depth, I conducted research in several areas. I gathered insights from trainers and active equestrians, studied the historical role of horses in human society, examined equestrian competitions, and investigated horse body language. The following video showcases some of my research in this field. Project Focus \u00b6 This project examines the complex relationship between humans and horses\u2014a relationship that oscillates between love, dominance, and sometimes competition. On the surface, this relationship appears as trust and coordination between two bodies, but beneath it lies pressure, inequality, and misunderstanding. The setting is not necessarily limited to an arena; any environment can serve as a platform for reflecting on this relationship. Layer One: Pressure from the Scoring System In equestrian competitions, each point represents success for humans, but for horses, it can signify fatigue, strain, or even injury. To achieve higher scores, riders often push horses beyond their limits, causing physical exhaustion. This project aims to reveal this hidden cycle: a visual representation shows a score table on a monitor alongside a human whose body becomes progressively more fatigued and worn with each point\u2014symbolizing the horse\u2019s physical and emotional burden. The human body becomes a metaphor for the horse\u2019s body, carrying effort, pain, and obedience simultaneously. Layer Two: Freedom and Choice for Horses The project questions the autonomy of horses: Are they truly at ease? Do they choose humans consciously? Would they be freer in open fields, experiencing wind and earth, rather than confined to a three-meter stall? Horses are typically taken out of their stalls only for training or competitions, spending most of their time waiting for scheduled feeding. In the best case, their enjoyment is limited to finding a carrot or receiving a small reward. This enforced stillness reflects a life where freedom becomes discipline, and joy becomes duty. Layer Three: Miscommunication Between Humans and Horses Humans cannot fully understand horse language, just as horses do not fully understand ours. Yet, we communicate through body language, sound, tone, gaze, and movement. Inspired by this, I designed an exercise in which two humans, who do not share a spoken language, interact using only voice, tone, gestures, and body posture. They then explain what they understood from each other. This experience mirrors the human-horse relationship, where words are absent and only perception, attention, and signals remain\u2014similar to a horse silently asking for something through its gaze or ear movements, leaving us to interpret. Potential Impacts of the Project \u00b6 Reveal Hidden Inequalities \u2013 Challenge the mechanical, score-focused approach in equestrian competitions and encourage a redefinition of success. Foster Physical Empathy \u2013 Allow the audience to not just see but feel the pressure, fatigue, and expectations from the horse\u2019s perspective. Redefine Human-Animal Relationships \u2013 Shift from dominance to understanding, respect, and coexistence. Encourage Ethical Reflection and Behavior Change \u2013 Invite reflection through body language and emotion rather than judgment. Promote Cross-Species Communication \u2013 Highlight that understanding can occur through observation, touch, and silence beyond verbal language. Measurable Objectives \u00b6 Experience Empathy \u2013 At least 70% of participants report feeling fatigue, limitation, or empathy with the horse (via forms or discussion). Critical Understanding \u2013 Participants can identify and discuss one unfair or overlooked practice in equestrian sports. Attitude Change \u2013 At least half of participants express willingness to reconsider the human-animal relationship. Observable Physical Reactions \u2013 Record changes in body language (movement speed, posture, gestures) during various parts of the experience. Long-Term Recall \u2013 Participants recall the core emotional experience in follow-up discussions days later. Type of Action \u00b6 The main action of the project combines resistance, protest, and invitation to reform: Resistance \u2013 Against instrumental and score-focused treatment of animals, simulating human exhaustion as a metaphor for the horse\u2019s body. Protest \u2013 Visual and emotional demonstration of unfair systems that ignore animal well-being. Invitation to Reform \u2013 Engaging audiences empathetically, encouraging reflection without violence or blame. The experience can be presented in three stations: Scores and Fatigue Display \u2013 A monitor shows scores while a human body becomes progressively exhausted, symbolizing the horse\u2019s strain. Confined Three-Meter Space \u2013 A controlled environment with intermittent sounds and silence to create a sense of waiting and limitation. Practical Experiment \u00b6 To fully understand my topic, I combined layers one and two by simulating the life of a show-jumping horse. I created a scenario to experience life in a small stall for 12 hours, simulating the confinement and conditions of competition. I observed behaviors I could emulate to gain a better understanding of the horse\u2019s experience. Despite my asthma and heart condition, I pushed myself as far as possible to execute this hypothesis. (Video of the performed action) Insights from Interviews and Observations \u00b6 Through interviews with riders and trainers, I identified key factors for preparing horses for competitions with less stress and more readiness: Specifying rest, training, and training type for each horse. Avoiding tasks beyond the horse\u2019s capability, understanding its physical limits, and knowing suitable jump heights. Considering veterinarians, nutrition, environment, medication, and post-training care such as massage and ice therapy. Ensuring harmony between horse and rider, built through shared time and mutual understanding. Recognizing that humans cannot fully interpret horse language; we rely on posture and body language to approximate meaning, similar to communicating with someone who speaks a different language. This reflection emphasizes the importance of empathy, awareness, and adaptation in fostering a healthier, more ethical relationship between humans and horses.","title":"Design Studio 1"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20studio%201/#design-studio-1-project-overview","text":"In Design Studio 1, we were asked to select a topic aligned with our personal interests.

We explored how we might improve and elevate ourselves by using our abilities and various tools, ultimately becoming better versions of who we are. In the following layers of the course, we considered what it would be like if we transformed into another being\u2014or possessed the abilities of other creatures\u2014and approached these ideas with a more creative perspective. Later, we analyzed how we would like others to perceive us, and how we could present and communicate that image. This course was particularly interesting for me because it genuinely taught me how to observe situations, people, and even myself from an external and alternative point of view. Day One: Becoming the Best Version of Myself \u00b6 Since childhood, I have had hearing difficulties and hear less than the average person. I have been wearing hearing aids since the age of five, and living with weak hearing\u2014even with hearing aids\u2014has always been a challenging experience. I have always wanted to reduce the impact of this challenge. What makes the process more complex is that doctors usually increase the sensitivity of hearing aids gradually and infrequently, since delivering excessive sound directly into the ear can cause further damage. Because of this, I wanted to design an external tool that could improve natural sound reception without transmitting sound directly into the ear. I created a device made of aluminum\u2014a material that does not absorb sound but reflects it. I designed its angle so that it naturally gathers and directs sound toward the ear, concentrating sound waves in the center before passing them along. This allows sounds to be amplified more naturally without artificial intervention, and without causing harm. Ultimately, I hope to turn this concept into an earring\u2014something both aesthetically pleasing and functional, easy to wear, and helpful for daily use. Day Two: Becoming Something Else \u00b6 On this day, we were asked to choose an ability from any creature we admired and design a tool that would allow us to use that ability. I have always found wall-climbing and rock-climbing extremely fascinating, as well as handstands\u2014being able to firmly connect to the ground with my hands and balance with my legs in the air. The concept I developed was a pair of gloves equipped with suction pads. These pads create suction upon contact with a wall, allowing the user to adhere to and move along vertical surfaces. The suction pads are made of rubber, while the glove itself is plastic so it can fully conform to the shape of the hand and fit securely. Day Three: How We Want Others to See Us \u00b6 For this part, I wanted to add a humorous touch to my design. Since I love sleeping and have always enjoyed it since childhood, I also wished that others would see me as awake and alert\u2014even when I\u2019m not. So, I created a pair of glasses with an image of my own open, attentive eyes behind the lenses, allowing me to sleep behind them. Since I normally wear glasses due to my weak eyesight, I used my own frames. The result was extremely amusing. In addition to this, we were required to become \u201cdetectives\u201d and observe our subjects at a specific time, or be observed by others ourselves. The idea was to see ourselves from someone else\u2019s perspective, and to explore how we wish to be perceived. It also helped us understand how to follow a subject carefully and accurately if we were the detective. This concept was inspired by Sophie Calle\u2019s book Double Game \u2013 The Detective, where the main character hires a detective to observe her and reveal how she appears from an external viewpoint. We recreated this concept, and I became the detective who observed one of my classmates. I documented my observations along with the exact times. Me as a Detective: my subject: Lauren 12:10 \u2014 sitting in the corner of the class on a wooden chair, relaxed. 12:20 \u2014 on the rooftop she\u2019s talking with Francesco, Max, and the others. 12:23 \u2014 i talked to her , she was saying she\u2019s been looking for an apartment, so some of her energy is spent on house hunting and all that. 12: 25\u2014 I showed her my prototype, and she laughed 12: 26\u2014she put on my glasses and looked so funny And I realized it\u2019s actually these glasses attract even more attention, and now everyone can tell I\u2019m asleep behind them. 12:30 \u2014 lost my subject 12:38 \u2014 she\u2019s eating lunch with Max. 12:40 \u2014 I joined them 12:43 \u2014 To avoid looking too obvious that i am detective, I asked where the grocery store was, saying I wanted to buy something. 12:47 \u2014 ayal joined too.

I have been wearing hearing aids since the age of five, and living with weak hearing\u2014even with hearing aids\u2014has always been a challenging experience. I have always wanted to reduce the impact of this challenge. What makes the process more complex is that doctors usually increase the sensitivity of hearing aids gradually and infrequently, since delivering excessive sound directly into the ear can cause further damage. Because of this, I wanted to design an external tool that could improve natural sound reception without transmitting sound directly into the ear. I created a device made of aluminum\u2014a material that does not absorb sound but reflects it. I designed its angle so that it naturally gathers and directs sound toward the ear, concentrating sound waves in the center before passing them along. This allows sounds to be amplified more naturally without artificial intervention, and without causing harm. Ultimately, I hope to turn this concept into an earring\u2014something both aesthetically pleasing and functional, easy to wear, and helpful for daily use.","title":"Day One: Becoming the Best Version of Myself"},{"location":"term1/03-reflection%20I/#day-two-becoming-something-else","text":"On this day, we were asked to choose an ability from any creature we admired and design a tool that would allow us to use that ability.

So, I created a pair of glasses with an image of my own open, attentive eyes behind the lenses, allowing me to sleep behind them. Since I normally wear glasses due to my weak eyesight, I used my own frames. The result was extremely amusing. In addition to this, we were required to become \u201cdetectives\u201d and observe our subjects at a specific time, or be observed by others ourselves. The idea was to see ourselves from someone else\u2019s perspective, and to explore how we wish to be perceived. It also helped us understand how to follow a subject carefully and accurately if we were the detective. This concept was inspired by Sophie Calle\u2019s book Double Game \u2013 The Detective, where the main character hires a detective to observe her and reveal how she appears from an external viewpoint. We recreated this concept, and I became the detective who observed one of my classmates. I documented my observations along with the exact times.

According to the product information and its manual, it offers: - AM and FM radio reception - Built-in loudspeaker for audio playback - Station presets (memory storage) - LCD display for tuning and functions - AUX-IN input to play external audio devices Overall, it functions as a retro-style radio with additional audio playback capabilities. How does it work? \u00b6 The Sunstech RPRD3000 is an analog radio receiver with digital controls. Its operation is based on receiving radio frequency (RF) signals, converting them into audio signals, and playing the sound through its internal speaker. 1) Radio Signal Reception The internal AM/FM antenna captures electromagnetic radio waves from broadcasting stations. The tuner selects a specific frequency in either the AM or FM band. A tuning circuit filters out all other frequencies, allowing only the chosen station to pass through. 2) Signal Conversion Once the radio wave is received: The tuner sends the RF signal into the demodulator. The demodulator separates the audio information from the RF carrier wave. The extracted audio becomes a low-level signal \u2014 too weak to hear yet. This is the basic principle of AM/FM demodulation. 3) Audio Amplification A built-in audio amplifier increases the strength of the audio signal. The amplified signal drives the internal 4W RMS loudspeaker. This turns the electrical audio signal into audible sound (vibrations in air). 4) Display and Controls A microcontroller inside the device reads user input from buttons: - Power - Band selection (AM/FM) - Tuning up/down - Volume control - Station presets It shows tuning frequency and settings on the LCD screen. So although the radio technology is analog, the user interface is digital. 5) AUX Mode When an external device (like a phone) is connected the AUX input bypasses the radio tuner. The external audio directly enters the amplifier, using the radio as a speaker system. No radio signal involved, just audio playback through its internal speaker. 6) Power System The device mainly runs from AC mains power. It may also include a backup power function to retain saved stations if unplugged.

The base for the build is a wood casing open on the front and back. The plastic plates on the front and the back connect to each other from within the casing while holding two circuit boards and other components between them. The back plate also has a battery box, and a connection point for the antenna. It also holds the transformer and its cable, and has an outlet for the cable to the plug. It has plastic extrusions to screw to the front plate through the inside of the radio device. Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore? \u00b6 Although the Sunstech RPRD3000 was fully functional and still working properly, it gradually became less practical for modern users. The device is based on traditional AM/FM radio technology and does not include features such as: - Wi-Fi or Internet radio - Bluetooth connectivity - Streaming services - Smart functions or app integration Because today most people listen to music, radio stations, and podcasts online through smartphones, smart speakers, or Bluetooth systems, this type of standalone radio is considered outdated. So, the device did not fail technically \u2014 it simply became less relevant due to changes in consumer habits and modern audio technology. Steps taken \u00b6 Cleaned the dust off the raido and brought it to the MDEF room. Disassembled using our toolbox. Separated into three main parts as follows: The box/case Back and front plastic cover Inner electronics and plastics Laid out all parts individually and documented. Testing \u00b6 After the disassembly process, we meticulously examined each individual component. Utilizing a precision lab power supply and a high-resolution multimeter, we conducted comprehensive tests to determine the optimal voltage required for each component\u2019s functionality. Report on Speaker and Amplifier \u00b6 What we found inside \u00b6 Our original device was a Sunstech Arch Audio RP-RD3000 radio. We opened it to explore the audio components and understand how the sound was originally generated and amplified. Inside, we found: - A passive speaker driver - A large main PCB containing the radio tuner, power supply, and control logic - Wires leading to where the amplifier section originally lived - A transformer-based power supply (AC-powered radio) Our goal was to tap into the speaker system and create our own external amplifier, controlled by an Arduino. The Speaker \u00b6 The internal speaker was a simple passive driver, meaning: - It cannot produce sound on its own - It needs an external audio amplifier - It cannot be driven directly by Arduino pins The two wires (yellow & black) originally connected to the internal amplifier. This meant we needed to create our own amplifier to drive it. The Main PCB \u00b6 The large PCB inside the radio handled: - Power regulation - Tuning circuitry - Display logic - Button scanning - Clock and memory functions But not the audio amplification; that part is normally done by a small, separate IC or sub-board, which was not functional for our purposes. We inspected the board to locate the amplifier stage, which is on the very left right under the heatsink. However because the radio used an integrated, transformer-powered supply, reusing this board safely would have been difficult. So instead, we abandoned the original amplifier system and built our own. Building Our Own Amplifier \u00b6 We tried to build a simple audio amplifier to drive the original radio speaker. The Arduino produces a low-power audio signal, so an external amplifier is needed to increase: - Voltage - Current - Power delivered to the speaker Our amplifier design We used a LM386 amplifier circuit, small, low-voltage, and safe to use on a breadboard. In order to build our amplifier we needed: - LM386 chip (which we found from fablab) - 10 \u00b5F capacitor - 100 \u00b5F capacitor - 0.047 \u00b5F capacitor - 10k potentiometer (which we found from fablab) - Speaker (the one from the rdio) Our Goal \u00b6 Our objective was to reinterpret part of the vintage radio by allowing the Arduino to become the new \u201cbrain\u201d of the audio system. By creating our own amplifier, we gained full control over: - Sound generation - Volume and gain - Interaction with sensors, buttons, or touch pads Report on LCD and Control Module \u00b6 What we found inside \u00b6 One of the main components we wanted to work with was the comtrol module. It was a circuit board in the front that held a microcontroller, an LCD module, buttons that were activated using silicon buttons with a conductive base, and a variety of smaller components to support these. Microcontroller \u00b6 The board had it\u2019s own microcontroller. On further inspection and research, the microcontroller had functions to control the entire device. It had inputs from the buttons and outputs to the components to allow for tuning through FM and AM Oscillators, memory storage and button control to access them (through the numpad), and other such features. It allows: Tuning function: Manual tuning (up/down) Direct tuning Seek tuning Memory function: FM/MW/LW or TV/SW/WB each band 10 stations Clock function: Dual clock function 12/24H clock Sleep timer function Alarm timer function Other function: Battery check input Here is a detailed map: We wanted to hack the chip to be able to access these controls but we were not sure of how to go about this. LCD Module \u00b6 The LCD module has number markers and some preset icons like battery low, alarm set, and a backlight. We wanted to open it up to see the component serial number, but this proved difficult due to deteriorated screws. The pins above the controller are going to the screen and possibly some of the other pins around the microcontroller. On connecting the power button, the screen turned on, and faded away soon after, while showing the low battery message. (Indicating the activation of the battery checker?) Here you can see the numbers and a few of the other icons. Buttons \u00b6 The buttons had a silicon component with a conductive base, and circuitry inbuilt in the chip. The circuit buttons The silicon buttons The conductive part at the back The alternating teeth in the circuit were fascinating, and we played with this quite a bit later on. It was difficult to understand the different points for accessing the individual buttons and we struggled with this quite a bit. Outputs \u00b6 The clearly labelled outputs for the board helped us understand the controls immediately on opening the board. The labelling for GND, POWER, BAND, FMOSC, AMOSC , BUZZ, LED, 3V3 helped us follow the circuit through and locate the oscillators, decode that the alarm used the amplifier and not a buzzer, etc. Component Details \u00b6 Here are further details of the components: Image Component Manufacturer Serial no. PCB HAMco H5080KEY Microcontroller Silan SC9318FB-033 LCD Screen n/a Text Silicon Buttons n/a Text Our Goal \u00b6 We attempted to transform part of the circuit board into capacitative touch sensors to build a digital controller We repurposed the numpad buttons built-into the right side of the circuit board panel from the radio and connected it to the sensor pins of the Arduino. The original board had 6 buttons on the left that were designed to change radio settings when touched; and 9 buttons on the right in the form of a numpad that were controlling saved radio stations. To interface this with our computer, we soldered wires from the circuit-buttons on the radio\u2019s PCB to the numbered input pins on the Arduino. The soldering was a challenge as there were very few points for soldering. We had to use test points and other connected components to make it work. Alongside the soldering, we set up the Arduino to work as a capacitative sensor. The code features 4 musical notes activated on touching the sensor inputs. The note was temporarily played from the buzzer on the Barduino. The code is as below: void setup() { pinMode(4, INPUT); pinMode(5, INPUT); pinMode(6, INPUT); pinMode(7, INPUT); pinMode(46, OUTPUT); } void loop() { int touch_1 = touchRead(4); int touch_2 = touchRead(5); int touch_3 = touchRead(6); int touch_4 = touchRead(7); if (touch_1 > 100000){ tone(46, 164.81, 100); delay(100); } if (touch_2 > 100000){ tone(46, 87.31, 100); delay(100); } if (touch_3 > 100000){ tone(46, 110, 100); delay(100); } if (touch_4 > 100000){ tone(46, 220, 100); delay(100); } else { noTone(46); } } Each wire acted as its own input and each channel was programmed to output a different beat or frequency whenever it was touched. Allowing the pads to act as touch-activated musical controls. At the end, it did work as a capacitative sensor, but did not behave correctly. Instead of each pad being assigned to a different corresponding Arduino pin, most of the pads played all the notes, but with random jittering and gaps in the sound that varied from pad to pad. On connecting more than one arduino pin, it behaved as if all of them were playing continuously. Moving Forward \u00b6 The goal for next week is to manipulate or reinterpret the music that the radio originally played, using its touch sensor panel as a modern interactive interface. By using the Arduino, the working radio functions, one or more screens, and Touch Designer and other software, we would like to create some interesting interactive audio-visual effects and interactions.","title":"Unpacking Tech Systems I"},{"location":"term1/05-Unpacking%20Tech%20Systems%20I/#unpacking-tech-systems","text":"","title":"Unpacking Tech Systems"},{"location":"term1/05-Unpacking%20Tech%20Systems%20I/#forensic-report-the-radio","text":"Identity of the reporting agency MDEF Case identifier Forensics of the Obsolescence Identity of the submitter Hannah Peevey, Ishan Mudgal, Maryam Shojaei, S\u0131la Kara Date of receipt 19.11.2024 Date of report 20.11.2024 Identity and signature of the examiner Hannah, Ishan, Maryam, S\u0131la Status Somehow Works","title":"Forensic Report: The Radio"},{"location":"term1/05-Unpacking%20Tech%20Systems%20I/#the-radio","text":":::info Brand: Sunstech Serial number: SPA / 090100471 Model: Arch Audio RP-RD3000 Colour: Dark Wood (Box), Black (Back and Front Face) Made in: China :::","title":"The Radio"},{"location":"term1/05-Unpacking%20Tech%20Systems%20I/#examination","text":"Picture Part Name Serial number Quantity Specifications Made in Outer Body - 1 wood veneer - Front panel - 1 injection-molded plastic - Buttons - 1 silicon plastic : power, band selection, tuning, volume, preset selection - LCD screen Board H5080key Ver 2.0 1 Board HAMco Cupper Sheet - 1 Electromagnetic shielding - Main Radio Board H5080 Radio Ver 1.8/2008 02 18 1 silicon plastic : power, band selection, tuning, volume, preset selection HAMco Alarm Button - 1 injection-molded plastic - Sleep Button - 1 injection-molded plastic - Speaker - 1 Single internal speaker for audio output - Speaker Mesh - 1 Protects speaker and allows sound through - Speaker Plastic washer - 1 Secures speaker, reduces vibration, prevents rattling So together - Rotary volume control knob - 1 User interface for adjusting volume - Power supply transformer YSP-1120070V 1 Converts mains AC voltage to lower DC/AC voltage for the circuit Rear Panel - 1 providing access to power and internal components, injection-molded plastic - Battery Cover - 1 A removable plastic cover that protects the batteries - Batteries - 1 Provide portable power when the radio is not connected to AC -","title":"Examination"},{"location":"term1/05-Unpacking%20Tech%20Systems%20I/#forensic-questions","text":"","title":"Forensic Questions"},{"location":"term1/05-Unpacking%20Tech%20Systems%20I/#what-does-it-do","text":"The Sunstech RPRD3000 is a portable/desktop AM/FM radio designed mainly for home use.

The original board had 6 buttons on the left that were designed to change radio settings when touched; and 9 buttons on the right in the form of a numpad that were controlling saved radio stations. To interface this with our computer, we soldered wires from the circuit-buttons on the radio\u2019s PCB to the numbered input pins on the Arduino. The soldering was a challenge as there were very few points for soldering. We had to use test points and other connected components to make it work. Alongside the soldering, we set up the Arduino to work as a capacitative sensor. The code features 4 musical notes activated on touching the sensor inputs. The note was temporarily played from the buzzer on the Barduino. The code is as below: void setup() { pinMode(4, INPUT); pinMode(5, INPUT); pinMode(6, INPUT); pinMode(7, INPUT); pinMode(46, OUTPUT); } void loop() { int touch_1 = touchRead(4); int touch_2 = touchRead(5); int touch_3 = touchRead(6); int touch_4 = touchRead(7); if (touch_1 > 100000){ tone(46, 164.81, 100); delay(100); } if (touch_2 > 100000){ tone(46, 87.31, 100); delay(100); } if (touch_3 > 100000){ tone(46, 110, 100); delay(100); } if (touch_4 > 100000){ tone(46, 220, 100); delay(100); } else { noTone(46); } } Each wire acted as its own input and each channel was programmed to output a different beat or frequency whenever it was touched. Allowing the pads to act as touch-activated musical controls. At the end, it did work as a capacitative sensor, but did not behave correctly. Instead of each pad being assigned to a different corresponding Arduino pin, most of the pads played all the notes, but with random jittering and gaps in the sound that varied from pad to pad. On connecting more than one arduino pin, it behaved as if all of them were playing continuously.","title":"Our Goal"},{"location":"term1/05-Unpacking%20Tech%20Systems%20I/#moving-forward","text":"The goal for next week is to manipulate or reinterpret the music that the radio originally played, using its touch sensor panel as a modern interactive interface.

The initial step involved developing the design in Rhino, where I was responsible for creating the two main side panels of the mold. The first side explored a fully abstract form, centered around curves and fluidity, inspired by the organic movement of worms in nature. The second side translated a more symbolic idea: two pine trees positioned back-to-back, creating a mirrored natural structure. Design Constraint: \u00b6 One of the key challenges in this phase was adapting the designs to the technical limitations of the laser cutter. The laser paths could not be placed too close together, which required multiple iterations and design refinements. Ultimately, we selected and modified the final forms to comply with the laser cutter\u2019s tolerances while preserving the intended visual identity. Tools & Materials: Laser Cutter MDF Rhino Tolerance Calibration 3D Printing the Core Geometry \u00b6 The second phase focused on creating the main solid piece with a cubic structure using a 3D printer. Here, we intentionally pushed the design concept further by drawing inspiration from the pyramids of Egypt and the Great Sphinx. Alongside the pyramidal forms, we added a small spiral element\u2014referencing speculative narratives about extraterrestrial gateways connected to the Giza pyramids. This piece was carefully modeled and prepared for 3D printing, with close attention to printability, wall thickness, and overall structural stability. Print Strategy: \u00b6 Ensuring that the design was fully printable became a crucial learning moment. Managing supports, avoiding problematic overhangs, and preventing surface defects required a deeper understanding of slicing logic and printer behavior. This process significantly strengthened my comprehension of how digital geometry translates into physical form. Tools & Materials: 3D Printer PLA Slicing Software Silicone Molding \u00b6 After completing the 3D print, we moved into the molding phase using silicone. The printed piece served as the positive, and the silicone was poured and left to cure. Unexpected Challenge: \u00b6 A major difficulty emerged during demolding. Since the laser-cut wooden panels were placed inside the mold and featured numerous small, closely spaced engraved details, the silicone bonded to them more strongly than anticipated. Separating the cured silicone mold from the wooden structure was unexpectedly difficult and required patience and careful handling. This experience highlighted how small design decisions\u2014such as density and proximity of details\u2014can dramatically affect later fabrication stages. Materials: Silicone Mold Release CNC-Milled Frame Inspired by Mycelium \u00b6 CNC-Milled Frame Inspired by Mycelium For the outer frame of the final piece, we used CNC milling, with the entire design process developed in Rhino. The conceptual inspiration for this frame came from the growth patterns of fungal mycelium\u2014organic, branching structures that follow a natural yet complex logic. The 3D form was modeled in Rhino and then prepared for CNC machining, resulting in a wooden frame with an expressive, biomorphic geometry. This organic enclosure was designed to contrast with\u2014and simultaneously support\u2014the rigid, geometric language of the pyramidal core. Fabrication Insight: This phase progressed without major technical challenges, allowing us to focus primarily on form development, surface continuity, and the translation of complex organic geometry into a subtractive manufacturing process. Tools & Materials: CNC Router Wood Rhino Biomaterial Casting \u00b6 In the final fabrication step, we used the silicone mold to cast the core object using a biomaterial mixture. Once cured, the biomaterial piece\u2014carrying the pyramidal and spiral geometry\u2014was placed inside the CNC-milled mycelium-inspired frame. This combination of biomaterials, digital fabrication, and natural form references created a layered narrative between ancient architecture, speculative mythology, and biological systems. Materials: Biomaterial Compound Casting Process Final Reflection \u00b6 This project was particularly valuable because each stage introduced distinct challenges that deepened our understanding of both tools and materials. From laser-cut tolerances and 3D print constraints to unexpected silicone adhesion, every obstacle became an opportunity for learning. Anticipation Design decisions made early in the process directly influenced later fabrication stages. Adaptation Problem-solving and flexibility were essential, especially when outcomes differed from expectations. Integration By combining laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC milling, and biomaterial casting, the project demonstrated how diverse fabrication methods can coexist within a single cohesive design system. Ultimately, this experience reinforced that prototyping is not a linear process, but an evolving dialogue between concept, material, machine, and intuition.","title":"Fundamentals for Future Makers"},{"location":"term1/07-Fundamentals%20for%20Future%20Makers/#fundamentals-for-future-makers","text":"","title":"Fundamentals for Future Makers"},{"location":"term1/07-Fundamentals%20for%20Future%20Makers/#laser-cutting-mold-structure","text":"In the first stage of the project, we focused on designing and fabricating the wooden mold structure using laser cutting.
