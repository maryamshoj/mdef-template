My work focuses on tackling social and environmental challenges through thoughtful, human-centered design. Currently, I am pursuing my Master\u2019s degree at IAAC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia) in Barcelona, where I explore innovative approaches to design and technology integration. My background includes experience in product, interior, packaging, and visual design, with a strong emphasis on design thinking and sustainable practices. I believe design has the power to transform how we live and interact with the world \u2014 not only by solving problems but by inspiring a more conscious and creative future. As a female entrepreneur and designer, I aim to bring empathy, precision, and purpose into every project I take on, from concept to execution. Beyond design, I am also a professional show jumping rider, deeply passionate about equestrian sports. I hope to one day merge these two worlds \u2014 combining my love for horses with my design expertise \u2014 to contribute meaningfully to the development of innovative and human-centered solutions in the equestrian field. For me, design is more than a profession; it\u2019s a way to connect people, nature, and innovation in harmony.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#about","text":"I\u2019m Maryam Shojaei, a designer passionate about creating meaningful designs that blend aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability.

These signals highlight early signs of environmental, social, and technological change that may later shape global challenges. By studying them, we aim to understand how design can respond with awareness and resilience. Rather than predicting the future, our approach focuses on adaptability and coexistence \u2014 using design as a tool to imagine responsible, inclusive, and sustainable ways of living in an ever-changing world. creator or destroyer? \u00b6 There are two different dimensions within every human being: one of creation and one of destruction. Every person carries both aspects in their life, though sometimes they become fully aware of them. In rare, profound moments, a person may notice the consequences of their own destructive actions and consciously choose to create something meaningful instead. Many of the salvations and positive changes we have experienced in life have arisen from such moments of awareness. Yet, life is unpredictable. In the very next moment, the same person might make a choice that is careless or harmful \u2014 they might indulge in fast fashion, contributing to environmental damage, or, from a broader perspective, even make decisions that devastate entire cities. Despite this, I have sought to embrace the creative dimension in my own way. In Bandar Khamir, on Qeshm Island, I planted trees for the Earth, nurturing life in a fragile environment. This act of planting reminded me of the resilience of nature: even from the heart of destruction, life can emerge. It is much like the mangrove trees I planted that sprouted in my brother\u2019s mind, symbolizing hope, regeneration, and the enduring power of creation amidst destruction. Inner Consciousness \u00b6 This piece, in the very fabric of its being, has a story woven into its threads \u2014 a story that perhaps we don\u2019t fully know, whose secrets are hidden. When I got closer, I noticed how tiny words were written across the fabric. Isn\u2019t that fascinating? Like our subconscious mind, we may not even know its secrets ourselves, but when we look inward and explore, we become aware and discover things about ourselves. I had been having strange dreams for a while \u2014 about Rome, about a warrior woman in Rome fighting for her city with all her heart. Later, I realized that perhaps it was part of a past life. What story was hidden in it? How does it connect to my current life? Did understanding it help me? The answer is yes. I realized I have knots in this life that stem from the past, and I tried to resolve them. Because I resolved them, I am here now. Before this, interestingly, my plans to come to Spain wouldn\u2019t work \u2014 something always blocked them. But after I resolved and reconciled with myself and that part of me, I was able to enter a new chapter of my life. And the most important principle for the future of humanity is awareness: awareness of our inner self, awareness of ourselves, and awareness of the world. Humanity as Patience \u00b6 Just as one must wait patiently while fishing to catch a fish, in nature, one must also be patient to witness a phenomenon or to see a living creature, an animal, or a particular species. Perhaps one of our problems as humans is that we have become a bit impatient. Modern life, mobile phones, and the internet have all contributed to this impatience, because everything now comes so quickly. Yet nature preserves its own rhythm. That is why, whenever humans return to nature, they learn not to forget their essence, to avoid greed, to be patient, kind, and to embrace many other lessons that nature teaches. Nature guides us inward, toward self-awareness. Perhaps if the world\u2019s political leaders were also more aware of themselves, they would learn patience. They might understand that on this tiny planet, we humans are the smallest particles in the vastness of galaxies, and that war serves no purpose other than exhausting ourselves and depleting our resources. Perhaps if I hadn\u2019t walked all that way, I would not have seen that beautiful yellow butterfly \u2014 just as I patiently waited from seven in the morning until five in the afternoon with my uncle to catch a fish.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals explores subtle emerging patterns that reveal possible directions for our collective future.

We explored how we might improve and elevate ourselves by using our abilities and various tools, ultimately becoming better versions of who we are. In the following layers of the course, we considered what it would be like if we transformed into another being\u2014or possessed the abilities of other creatures\u2014and approached these ideas with a more creative perspective. Later, we analyzed how we would like others to perceive us, and how we could present and communicate that image. This course was particularly interesting for me because it genuinely taught me how to observe situations, people, and even myself from an external and alternative point of view. Day One: Becoming the Best Version of Myself Since childhood, I have had hearing difficulties and hear less than the average person. I have been wearing hearing aids since the age of five, and living with weak hearing\u2014even with hearing aids\u2014has always been a challenging experience. I have always wanted to reduce the impact of this challenge. What makes the process more complex is that doctors usually increase the sensitivity of hearing aids gradually and infrequently, since delivering excessive sound directly into the ear can cause further damage. Because of this, I wanted to design an external tool that could improve natural sound reception without transmitting sound directly into the ear. I created a device made of aluminum\u2014a material that does not absorb sound but reflects it. I designed its angle so that it naturally gathers and directs sound toward the ear, concentrating sound waves in the center before passing them along. This allows sounds to be amplified more naturally without artificial intervention, and without causing harm. Ultimately, I hope to turn this concept into an earring\u2014something both aesthetically pleasing and functional, easy to wear, and helpful for daily use. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gSjQHuu41E Day Two: Becoming Something Else On this day, we were asked to choose an ability from any creature we admired and design a tool that would allow us to use that ability. I have always found wall-climbing and rock-climbing extremely fascinating, as well as handstands\u2014being able to firmly connect to the ground with my hands and balance with my legs in the air. The concept I developed was a pair of gloves equipped with suction pads. These pads create suction upon contact with a wall, allowing the user to adhere to and move along vertical surfaces. The suction pads are made of rubber, while the glove itself is plastic so it can fully conform to the shape of the hand and fit securely. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA9RkvwKXEo Day Three: How We Want Others to See Us For this part, I wanted to add a humorous touch to my design. Since I love sleeping and have always enjoyed it since childhood, I also wished that others would see me as awake and alert\u2014even when I\u2019m not. So, I created a pair of glasses with an image of my own open, attentive eyes behind the lenses, allowing me to sleep behind them. Since I normally wear glasses due to my weak eyesight, I used my own frames. The result was extremely amusing. In addition to this, we were required to become \u201cdetectives\u201d and observe our subjects at a specific time, or be observed by others ourselves. The idea was to see ourselves from someone else\u2019s perspective, and to explore how we wish to be perceived. It also helped us understand how to follow a subject carefully and accurately if we were the detective. This concept was inspired by Sophie Calle\u2019s book Double Game \u2013 The Detective, where the main character hires a detective to observe her and reveal how she appears from an external viewpoint. We recreated this concept, and I became the detective who observed one of my classmates. I documented my observations along with the exact times. Me as a Detective: my subject: Lauren 12:10 \u2014 sitting in the corner of the class on a wooden chair, relaxed. 12:20 \u2014 on the rooftop she\u2019s talking with Francesco, Max, and the others. 12:23 \u2014 i talked to her , she was saying she\u2019s been looking for an apartment, so some of her energy is spent on house hunting and all that. 12: 25\u2014 I showed her my prototype, and she laughed 12: 26\u2014she put on my glasses and looked so funny And I realized it\u2019s actually these glasses attract even more attention, and now everyone can tell I\u2019m asleep behind them. 12:30 \u2014 lost my subject 12:38 \u2014 she\u2019s eating lunch with Max. 12:40 \u2014 I joined them 12:43 \u2014 To avoid looking too obvious that i am detective, I asked where the grocery store was, saying I wanted to buy something. 12:47 \u2014 ayal joined too.
