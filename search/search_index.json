My work focuses on tackling social and environmental challenges through thoughtful, human-centered design. Currently, I am pursuing my Master\u2019s degree at IAAC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia) in Barcelona, where I explore innovative approaches to design and technology integration. My background includes experience in product, interior, packaging, and visual design, with a strong emphasis on design thinking and sustainable practices. I believe design has the power to transform how we live and interact with the world \u2014 not only by solving problems but by inspiring a more conscious and creative future. As a female entrepreneur and designer, I aim to bring empathy, precision, and purpose into every project I take on, from concept to execution. For me, design is more than a profession; it\u2019s a way to connect people, nature, and innovation in harmony.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#about","text":"I\u2019m Maryam Shojaei, designer passionate about creating meaningful designs that blend aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability.

Students begin by developing personal ideas and learning to design collectively, while understanding technological systems and extended intelligence. Alongside studio projects, they engage in reflective courses such as Narratives and Digital Gardening, which connect conceptual thinking with creative expression. The term also introduces interdisciplinary exploration through topics like Other Species and Extended Intelligence, emphasizing the relationship between nature, humans, and technology. Finally, students acquire hands-on skills in digital fabrication, learning how to transform their ideas into tangible prototypes and meaningful design outcomes.","title":"Initial ideas"},{"location":"project/project/#term1","text":"The first term focuses on exploring design through experimentation, collaboration, and reflection.
